# Terminar
This is a program I spent a day or so on to get the UON calendar appear in the terminal

# Prerequisites 

- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- Requests ``pip install requests``

# How to use

Just simply run it with ``python terminar.py``. You can also run ``python terminar.py -C`` for a condensed version of the timetable


# NEW NOTE:

This application may not work all around the year due to changes in the calendar. If you see any errors or weird bugs due to this, please make an issue. Thank you
